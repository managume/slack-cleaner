# slack-cleaner

 Bored of deleting your Slack files one by one?

 This is a selenium webdriver script to delete all your files stored in Slack,
 while the dev team adds this functionality for unpaid accounts.

 Before execute the python script:
 
 1. Install Python:
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
 2. Install Selenium:
  pip install selenium
  
 3. Put the file of Chrome Webdriver in the same directory of the script .py
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home
  
 4.Edit the script and change the values of the following variables
 according with your Slack account credentials:

```python
    email = "Insert your email account"
    usr = "Insert your username"
    pwd = "Insert your password"
    team = "Insert the name of your team"
```
