# slack-cleaner

 Bored of deleting your Slack files one by one?

 This is a selenium webdriver script to delete all your files stored in Slack,
 while the dev team adds this functionality for unpaid accounts.

 Before execute the python script:
 
 1. Install Python:
  https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
 2. Install Selenium:
  pip install selenium
  
 3. Put the file of Chrome Webdriver in the same directory of the script .py

 4.Edit the script and change the values of the following variables
 according with your Slack account credentials:
 
 #INSERT CREDENTIALS
    email = "USER@gmail.com"
    pwd = "PASS"
 #INSERT URL FILES
    url = "https://TEAM.slack.com/files"
 #INSERT URL MY FILES
    url_myfiles = "https://TEAM.slack.com/files/USER"
